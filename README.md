# diabetes-prediction
This repository consists of Diabetes Prediction likelihood based on health metrics. It is used to check whether the person is diabetic or not.
• Worked on multiple Data Science libraries like:- "numpy, pandas, SVM, sklearn"

• Created a project of ”Diabetes Prediction”. The project can predict if a person is a diabetic patient or not.

• The project works on random forest, (SVM)Support Vector Machine, and (KNN)K- Nearest Neighbour algorithm, for improving prediction accuracy.
